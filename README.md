##MothMusicPlayer

MMP is a music player for linux written in Python3, GTK3 and Gstreamer,
altough there is a version written in Python2 and pygtk (GTK2).
The project is in a early development stage and the code is messy and
needs major refactoring.

The idea behind this project was to create a simple, and lightweight music
player for linux operating systems. The GUI lacks functionality (buttons etc.),
however almost any control can be accessed with vim-like commands:
- :p play
- :pa pause
- :ne next
- :pr prevous
- *...you can peak into console.py to see the full list of actions*
